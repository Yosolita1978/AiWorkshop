## Getting Started

1. **Create Your Workshop Copy**: 
   - In [the Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yosolita1978/AiWorkshop/blob/main/GenerativeAI_Workshop.ipynb) file menu, select "Save a copy in Drive" to have your own version of the workshop. This is crucial for installing packages and creating images.

2. **Connect to Google Colab Server**:
   - On the right side of your screen in Google Colab, find the connection options.
   - By default, you'll be assigned a T4 GPU with 16GB of memory. For better performance, opt for a 100 GPU, although it may incur costs.

3. **Prepare Your Workspace**:
   - Create a folder for your photos, preferably named using a unique handle (e.g., a combination of your name).
   - Ensure all photos are 512x512 pixels to avoid errors.

## Running the Workshop

1. **Execute the Code**:
   - Google Colab assigns server space to run the code. You'll use either console commands (prefixed with `!`) or Python code directly.
   - Begin by running the first blocks of code. Click the "Play" button beside each code block to execute.

2. **Configure Your Model**:
   - Update the code to recognize your photo directory by changing the handle in the specified line.
   - Specify the class of your avatar, e.g., "a photo of a woman", in the model parameters to personalize the output.

3. **Train Your Model**:
   - Training might take up to 15 minutes. Patience is key.
   - Once training is complete, you can start experimenting with your model.

## Experimentation and Results

- Use your unique handle to generate images with Stable Diffusion.
- The process allows for creative input, so experiment with different prompts to see what the model can create.

## Conclusion

This workshop provides a hands-on experience with the Stable Diffusion algorithm, teaching you to create personalized avatars for social media. Follow the steps carefully, and enjoy the process of bringing your digital identity to life!
